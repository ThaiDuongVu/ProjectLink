//description
Blue and Pink are trapped in an underground cave where the only way out is via color-code portals. Help them navigate the tricky, sometimes harzardous environment to get back to the surface world.

Swing you way through the cave towards your objective. If you mess up a swing, simply undo.

Interact with the environments and solve the puzzle. Be careful, it can be dangerous sometimes.

Enter the portals to advance to the next level and get one step closer to the surface world!
